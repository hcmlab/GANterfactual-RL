## User-Study Evaluation

This folder contains the code for the evaluation of our user study.

### Evaluation

*result_cleaning.py* takes the anonymized raw results from our survey tool (*finishedsurvey_anonymized.csv*) and cleans 
them. 
In particular, this includes:
* removing artifact data generated by the survey tool.
* checking whether the answers in each task are correct.
* combining the answers for the three sub-tasks for each task.
* filtering participants that did not use any counterfactuals during the first task.
* combining the Explanation Satisfaction answers for each task.

These results are saved in *cleaned_data.csv*.
Furthermore, *result_cleaning.py* creates *interesting_values.csv* which only contains the most interesting and aggregated 
results.

Finally, it creates three dataframes that only contain the main values (corresponding to our main hypotheses) for each 
pair of conditions (*mv_control_olson.csv*, *mv_control_starGAN.csv*, and *mv_olson_starGAN.csv*). 
These were used to easily conduct Mann-Whitney-U-Tests with the open source software Jamovi (Version 2.2.5.0). 
The corresponding Jamovi files files are *control-olson.omv*, *control-starGAN.omv*, and *olson-starGAN.omv*.
